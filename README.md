This repository is to reimplement the model in ã€ŠReliance on Small Samples, the Wavy Recency Effect, and Similarity-Based Learningã€?as the final project of Mathematical Modeling in 2017 fall. 

## Code Structure
There are three main parts of this project. 

1. main.m: to run a simulation
2. *Env.m: environments an agent can interact with, e.g. TwoOptionsEnv.m
3. *Agent.m: agent with its behavior
